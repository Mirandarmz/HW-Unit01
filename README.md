# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Project description📝
The objective of the project was to ensure **accesibility**, clean the code, utilise semantic HTML elements, assure logical structures and have every link in the webpage to work. 

>As for semantic elements, tags such as **div** or **div class="footer"** were replaced for semantic elements such as **section** or **footer**. 

>It was assured that there was a logical structure within the HTML code. 

>**href** that didn't work were corrected by adding the appropriate ID and attribute selector.

>Paths for images were corrected and directories were rearrenged to be compatible with GitHub public pages.

>CSS code was corrected following DRY principle, redundant classes were deleted or merged as seen fit.

>Finally, a concise and descriptive title was added to the webpage. 

Codebase was improved and, at least in my opinion, expectations will definitely be exceeded. 


## Final product📍
The appearance and functionality of the webpage was **not** modified, meaning the final product looks something similar to this:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Demo/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)
